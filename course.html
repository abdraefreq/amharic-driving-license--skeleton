<p>After completing this test 
they are ready to take your place  
Driver's seat and its preparation 
save driving.</p>
<p>Before driving do the following basic
habits in this order:</p>
<li><b>Lock your doors</b></li>
<p>
Lock your doors to prevent unwanted
persons from opening your door or
entering your vehicle. Locking the doors
also reduces the possibility of the doors
opening if you are involved in a collision.
<p/>
<li><b>Adjust your seat and seat back.</b></li>

<p>Adjust your seat and seat back support
properly so that you are at least 25
centimeters (10 inches) away from the
steering wheel.<br><br>Be sure you can see over the steering
wheel. Many vehicles have a steering
wheel that can be tilted or moved
back and forth.<br> <br>Find a position that is
comfortable for you and that does not
block your view of the instrument panel.
Your elbows should be slightly bent when
your hands are properly positioned on
the steering wheel.<br> <br>Placing your left hand
at about the 9 o’clock position and your
right hand at about the 3 o’clock position
is recommended. (See Steering in this
chapter for more information.) As well,
your position must allow you to operate
the brake pedal and the accelerator.<br><br> In a
standard transmission vehicle, you must
also be able to push the clutch pedal all
the way to the floor.
 Be sure you can reach all the controls
and can relax your arms when you hold
the steering wheel.
</p>

<li><b>Adjust your head restraint</b></li>
<p>Use your head restraint correctly. Head
restraints in the proper position greatly
reduce the risk of injuries due to collisions
and sudden vehicle movements.
</p>
<p>1. If your vehicle has an adjustable head
restraint, it should be positioned so that
the centre of the head restraint is level
with the top of your ears. </p>
<p>2. If your head restraint tilts, move it
forward to decrease the space between
your head and the restraint. Less than
10 centimeters (4 inches) is ideal.</p>
<p>3. Always check that the head restraint
for each passenger is adjusted to the
correct height. </p>
<li><b>Adjust your inside and outside
rear view mirrors</b></li>
<p>Set your rear view mirrors in the
correct position.</p><p>1. Adjust your inside rear view mirror to
show as much behind you as possible
by having the rear window framed within
the mirror. </p>
<p>2. Adjust the outside rear view mirrors
to reduce blind spots. You should be
able to see your own vehicle in a small
portion of the side view mirror closest to
the vehicle</p>
<li><b>Fasten your seat belt</b></li>
<p>Fasten your seat belt and shoulder strap
correctly. Seat belts save lives and reduce
injuries, and provide the greatest protection
when worn properly. The law requires you
to wear your seat belt.</p>
<p>1. Wear the lap belt low and snug over
your hips. The shoulder belt must fit
over your chest and shoulder.</p>
<p>2. Do not tuck the shoulder belt behind
your back or under your arm.</p>
<p>3. You are still required to wear your seat
belt when in a vehicle with air bags</p>
<strong>When you are ready to go, do
the following:</strong><br><br>
<li>Check to be sure your intended path
of travel is clear.</li><br>
<li>Check your inside and outside rear
view mirrors</li><br>
<li>Do a shoulder check to be sure
your blind spots are clear.</li><br>
<p>If you are moving away from the right
side of the road, use your left turn signal
to indicate that you are entering traffic. If
you are on the left side of a one way road,
use your right turn signal. In this situation,
it can be difficult to see traffic clearly from
the driver’s seat.</p>
